<hr />


The Masque platform uses an API built in [**Ruby on Rails**][r], for mobile devices - the [**front end**][f] is built using [**React-Native**][rn] with plans to build a standard web version using [**React**][rjs] in the future.

- ## 📋 Requirements

  The requirements for running this application locally are the same as any [**Ruby on Rails**][r] application (requiring both ruby and the rails gem).

- ## 🎉 Installation and setup

  Once this repository is cloned, dependencies must be met through:

  ```bash
    bundle
  ```

  To run the API locally simply run:

  ```bash
    rails s
  ```

  This will start the dev server on port 3000 by default, which can then be connected to on your local machine for requests.

- ## 📖 Documentation

  - ### 🚧 Structure
    This project follows the basic MVC setup following your standard rails project setup. 
  - ### 🚗 Routing
    The breakdown for the routes of the api can be found on the `/api` path.
  - ### ⚛️ Front-end
    Currently there is only a mobile [**front end**][f] with plans for a web front-end to be completed at a later date.
